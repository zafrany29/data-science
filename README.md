This project is part of Data Siences Course on the 2nd year of my Comuter Sinece degree.

## **Main Function**
The main goal of the project is to predict the price of used cars.

We used a second-hand website that sells used cars, and we scraped around 70,000 samples of various types of cars using Selenium.

The project was done using Jupyter Notebook in Python. By applying several supervised machine learning methods, such as KNN, linear regression, and more, we attempted to predict the price of used cars.

## **Conclusions:**

We did not have enough samples for such a task. For cars that are commonly sold, we achieved very high accuracy, but we were not able to achieve the same success with less common cars.

**Note:**
The project will be modified and improved in future iterations.
