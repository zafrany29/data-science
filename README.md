# data-science

This is a data science project used for My BSc Computer Science degree.
Using various tools provided by Python's libraries, We were able to scrap and analyze deta from a car sales website,
to try and predict, used cars' value. All though the initial data frame was big after cleaning it we were left 
with not so many details for the task that was ahead of us. We were able to predict more accurately the prices of the most sold cars.
But, for the uncommon ones, we will need a bigger database.
